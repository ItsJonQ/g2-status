## G2 - Next.js Starter

Kick off your prototype with this G2 starter. This starter ships with the main [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) files you might need to get up and running blazing fast with the blazing fast app generator for React.

## ðŸš€ Quick start

1.  **Create a Next.js site.**

    Use the Next.js CLI to create a new site, specifying the default starter.

    ```shell
    # create a new Next.js site with G2
    npx create-next-app my-site --use-npm --example "https://github.com/itsjonq/next-g2-starter/"
    ```

1.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and start it up.

    ```shell
    cd my-site/
    npm start
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:3000`!

    Open the `my-site` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `pages/index.js`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!
